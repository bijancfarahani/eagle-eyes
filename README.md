# Eagle Eyes!
Eagle Eyes is a lightening-quick game that test your photo-memory.

## How to Play

The game begins by dealing the player nine shuffle cards, each with a different letter of the phrase ***eagle eyes***.
You need to quickly memorize the position of each card before they are all flipped face down.

 - Classic Mode, you're given a few seconds to quickly memorize the location of each card.
 - Modern Mode, you can take as much time as you like and can compete by submitting your time to a leaderboard upon winning.

Once the cards are no longer visible, the objective is to flip them back over in an order which spells out ***eagle eyes***.
